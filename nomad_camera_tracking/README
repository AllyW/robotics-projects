SETUP

install opencv and opencv python bindings
make sure the current directory is on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
chmod +x nodes/color_tracker.py

TO RUN

make
roslaunch nomad_camera_tracking nomad_camera_tracking.launch


NOTES

nodes/settings.py
  list all project constants here, so we don't have to pollute our code with magic numbers

nodes/color_tracker.py
  tracks a blob of a specified color
  publishes to a topic (blob_coord) the x,y coords of that blob

nodes/pan_tilt.py
  reads from blob_coord, does a frame transformation, and moves pan_tilt motors to center on the blob

TODO

publish PointStamped instead of Point for blob_coord 
define all the transforms in ROS terms
  world -> camera
  camera -> ball
  world -> pan/tilt base
  pan/tilt base -> laser pointer
publish the transforms (can check with rviz)
ROS node to control pan/tilt unit
controller (probably just proportional) to drive the error between laser and ball location to zero
