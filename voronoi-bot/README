OVERVIEW

voronoi-bot is a robot that navigates my creating a Generalized Voronoi Graph (GVG) and then traveling along this graph to reach the goal. It requires a full map of the environment in order to navigate.

I completed this project during a class for Joel Burdick while an undergrad at Caltech. I've since added the code to github and started cleaning up the files so that they're easier to understand and reuse (refactoring, adding tests, etc). This is still in progress, but the code is functional in the meantime.

See example_output/voronoi_plot.png for an example of the output (plotted in Matlab).

To read more about using GVG for navigation, I recommend the following:

SETUP

This project requires player:
http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/

in ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install robot-player


USAGE

Compile the project and create executables with:
$ make
Check the Makefile for location of includes if you encounter errors

In a terminal, start up player with
$ player cfg/voronoi.cfg
(in ubuntu, the executable is called robot-player)

In another terminal:
$ ./bin/voronoibot

After the robot completes the course, you can run the matlab/plotVoronoi.m file to plot the output
